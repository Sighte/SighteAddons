# Evaluator Rubric

Use this rubric after implementation and before final acceptance.

**Who fills this in:** a fresh session or subagent that did NOT implement the
work, using repository artifacts only (`feature_list.json`,
`claude-progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, the code, and the test output).
Self-grading by the implementing session does not count. If the evaluator
cannot reconstruct the state from the artifacts alone, that is itself a
finding (score Handoff readiness 0).

**Scoring:** 0 = fails, 1 = partial / with reservations, 2 = fully met.
The evaluator must re-run the relevant `verification_command`s, not just
read the recorded evidence.

| Category | Question | Score (0-2) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | Does the implemented behavior match the requested feature? |  |  |
| Verification | Did the required checks actually run, with evidence? |  |  |
| Regression | Are previously passing features still passing? |  |  |
| Scope discipline | Did the session stay inside the chosen feature scope? |  |  |
| Reliability | Does the result survive restart or rerun without repair? |  |  |
| Maintainability | Is the code and documentation clear enough for the next session? |  |  |
| Handoff readiness | Can a fresh session continue work from repo artifacts only? |  |  |

## Verdict

Derived from the scores — do not override without written justification:

- **Accept**: total ≥ 12 of 14, AND no category scored 0, AND Correctness,
  Verification and Regression all scored 2.
- **Revise**: no category scored 0, but the Accept bar is not met.
- **Block**: any category scored 0, or evidence could not be reproduced.
